What is Xfce?
=============

Xfce is a lightweight `desktop environment <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment>`_ built for simplicity and efficiency. Xfce takes up far less space than other desktop environments such as KDE, GNOME, Unity etc and is very responsive. Xfce philosophy is to get out of your way and let you complete your work efficiently and easily.

Xfce project has a high emphasis on stability meaning that core functionality does not change frequently causing you to re-learn your workflow.

Why not use other lightweight environments ?
============================================

You can! It is all about choice. There are a variety of reasons to use Xfce:

1. Familiar windows and other UI widgets.
2. Xfce is fairly powerful, despite being simple.
3. Xfce evolves slowly with bug fixes taking priority over feature addition and bloat.
4. Xfce is free and user-friendly

What is your point?
===================

Since Xfce is a fairly simple environment to set up, most folks do this on their own. There are some who use pre-configured environments such as Xubuntu. While this is a very valid choice, it is recommended that you set up your environment yourself. There may be different aspects of your system you care about and it is useful to get those right trade-offs that help you work effectively on your computer. This is actually where Xfce excells at and there are only a few environments out there that help you get them exactly right.
